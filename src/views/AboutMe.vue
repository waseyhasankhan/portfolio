          First thing first, I'ma say the things about my journey as a
          <code>coder</code>, <code>programmer</code>

          Myself <span class="span-1">Wasey Hasan Khan</span> , 25 year old
          self-educated, self-trained
          <span class="span-1">Front End Web Developer</span> from INDIA.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey as a coder, started after completing my graduation in
          <em> B.Sc(Maths and Chemistry)</em> in the pandemic ðŸ˜·ðŸ¦ ðŸ˜·. And it was
          the perfect timing to blend some equations and formulas with some
          syntaxes, loops, packages and many more.
        </p>

        <p class="my-5">
          Now about my career as a web-dev, I was introduced to
          <code>coding</code> world by my college friends. After researching
          thoroughly, I dedicated myself heartly to the web development. I
          learned the basics of <span>HTML and CSS</span> through some tutorials
          on YouTube and some other platforms like freeCodeCamp, but that was
          not enough to be a pro. So, I enrolled myself in the courses of one of
          the top instructor's of UDEMY, none other than,
          <span class="span-2">JONAS SCHMEDTMANN </span>
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/"
            target="_blank"
            >Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/"
            target="_blank"
            >Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!</a
          >. Only HTML and CSS was not enough to make a website fully dynamic,
          JavaScript is a must(which I learned). So I further joined his another
          awesome course,
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/"
            target="_blank"
            >The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!</a
          >
          <br />
          There, I coded some beautiful projects, which you can check on my
          GitHub repo.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to keep up with the latest tech stack, I further learned the
          newest JavaScript framework <strong>VUEJS</strong> by an experienced
          web developer and instructor, Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller through his
          course
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/"
            target="_blank"
            >Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & VueX)</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I have two rules in my life: <br />
          Rule No. 1: Never Stop Learning <br />
          Rule No. 2: Always remember Rule No. 1 <br />
